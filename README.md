# IN WHICH MAPS DO YOU NOT USE SCRIPTS?
Roblox only bans if it finds irregular activity in the chat. For example insults, racism, bullying or any words that may be offensive according to roblox (they may also contain words that are used every day in your language but which roblox considers offensive. [they will be fixed later and will no longer cause false roblox bans]) . Therefore they are the maps/experiences/modes that thanks to an anti-cheats could catch you or it could also have been the owner of the map or its controllers/moderators. The maps with the most bans counted and anti-cheats done better will be in this list:
- Blox Burg
- Tower of hell
- and other
PLAY THESE MAPS WITH SCRIPTS AT YOUR OWN RISK
